# gaia_roman_astrometry
Simulate combining Gaia catalogues with future Roman images to measure improved astrometry.

Uses the predicted Gaia astrometric precision for positions, parallaxes, and proper motions for DR3 to DR5 as presented by the [Gaia Collaboration](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/science-performance).
